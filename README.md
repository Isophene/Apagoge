### What is this repository?
An alternative download page for Github releases which only shows additional binarys, the description of the release and the author of the release. The aim was to provide a faster alternative for choosing a build/download. Similar to Jenkins, however relying on functionality already within Github.

### Can I modify it?
You may modify this repository in any way you please, if you'd like to add monetization (such as Google Ads), please get in touch with me first. 

### There is an XSS vulnerability
I'm aware, however I won't be patching XSS in this repository as the environments I run this in will not be influenced, feel free to fix it in your own fork and make a pull request.
